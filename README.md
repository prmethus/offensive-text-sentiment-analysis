# Offensive Text Sentiment Analysis
A binary classifier neural network created with tensorflow.keras that uses word embedding to predict whether a sentence contains offensive (bullying, sexism, etc.) words or not.
The accuracy for training and validation surpasses 95% but not more than that.
Additional hyperparameter tunings haven't been performed to reduce overfitting.
The model has been trained on (Mendeley's Cyberbullying dataset)[https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jf4pzyvnpj/1]
