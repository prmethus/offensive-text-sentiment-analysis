# offensive-text-sentiment-analysis

A binary classifier neural network created with tensorflow.keras that uses word embedding to predict whether a sentence contains offensive words or not.
The accuracy for training and validation surpasses 95% but not more than that.
Additional hyperparameter tunings haven't been performed to reduce overfitting.
